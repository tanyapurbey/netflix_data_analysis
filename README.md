# Netflix_data_analysis

Welcome to my first Data Analysis Project based on NETFLIX CONTENT!
Here , I explored a real world dataset from Netflix with data cleaning and data analysis using Pandas to uncover some wonderful key insights about movies and shows available on the platform. I  performed ***Exploratory DATA Analysis (EDA)*** to
find hidden patterns.

### Dataset
* SOURCE : [Netflix Titles dataset on Kaggle]
* contains two csv files named titles and credits which contains information on shows and movies from 1945 to 2021
* Titles, release year ,rating ,production countries, genres ,description, runtime , characters ,cast , imDB rating and votes etc.

### Key Takeaways
- Improved my data wrangling skills
- Gained confidence in using ***Pandas** for real world analysis.
- Turned raw info into real insights
- Practiced end-to-end project thinking

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas

### Some KEY Insights
